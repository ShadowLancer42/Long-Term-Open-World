# Long-Term-Open-World
Unity project that's open world, and RPG style somewhat.

Okay so this is a Unity3D project on version 2019.4.14f1. If you want to contact me, email me at glenseeber42@gmail.com (you can also find this email on my profile).

If you want me to accept your pull request for your fork, you can either: 
1. Do something listed on the projects tab
2. If you want to do something that isn't listed, you can email me and ask if it's something I would like to have in my project.
3. You could also just do something, and then send me some video or screenshots of what it is, and I'll accept a pull request if I like it.

If you choose to do either 2 or 3, you need to email me about it before you put in the request.

If you put in a pull request without following the rules, I'm not accepting it.

***Read STANDARDS.md before contributing to the project***
